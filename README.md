python script for turning an ipod universal dock remote into a ipod bluetooth remote useing a pi pico


you will need 

1x pi pico (duh)
1x apple universal dock remote (a1156 used here others shuld works but do you testing)
some wire to hook stuff up

guide for a a1156 remote (idk about any others so upto you)

1. disasemble your universal dock remote
idc how you do it just try not to brake the pcb 

2. take off the buttons leaving just the contacts on the pcb

3.solder a wire to the middel contacts 

4.solder a wire to the top battery tab (the one on same side of the buttons) this is for power as the buttons need to be pulled high 

5. solder a wire to the other battery contact

6. solder up to your pi pico

7. change pins in the code to match what pins you solderd to

8. power the pico up and run the code

9. to test if it works you will need to use an app like "arduino bluettoh controler" 

10. now you can controler your ipod via bluetooth yey
but was that worth it did you have nothing better to do with your life than to make someting as pointless as this 
no
well same now enjoy
